shm.py:

	Widget to illustrate solution of simple harmonic oscillator equation.
	Shows how solution

 	      x(t) = a*cos(2*pi*f - phi)

	depends on choice of amplitude, a, frequency, f, and phase angle, phi.

shmani.py:

	cardinal points of oscillation on mouse clicks.


shmenergy.py:

	Animation to illustrate energy flows in simple harmonic motion.
	Pauses on mouse click.

shmcircle.py:

	Animation to illustrate relationship between simple harmonic and circular motion.
	Animation freezes on mouse clicks.
