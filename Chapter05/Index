massspringfree.py:

	Animation to illustrate normal modes of spring-coupled
	mass system with left end free and right end fixed.

	Input parameters:

	n - number of masses
	k - mode number
	a - relative anplitude
	t - time step

massspringfreew.py:

	Script to plot normal frequecies of mass-spring system with left end free and
	right end fixed.

	Input parameters:

	n - number of masses

massspringfixed.py:

	Animation to illustrate normal modes of spring-coupled
	mass system with both ends fixed.

	Input parameters:

	n - number of masses
	k - mode number
	a - relative anplitude
	t - time step

rod.py:

	Animation of displacement of rigid rod with left end free and right end fixed.
	Rod lies between x = 0 and x = l.
	Initial condition is that section of rod lying between x = 0 and x = a < l
	is initially moving to right with velocity V0, and remainder of rod is at rest. 
	Animation freezes on mouse click.

	Input parameters:

	k  - number of harmomics
	a  - relative length of section of rod initially in motion
	t  - time step

rodv.py:

	Animation of velocity of rigid rod with left end free and right end fixed.
	Rod lies between x = 0 and x = l.
	Initial condition is that section of rod lying between x = 0 and x = a < l
	is initially moving to right with velocity V0, and remainder of rod is at rest. 
	Animation freezes on mouse click.

	Input parameters:

	k  - number of harmomics
	a  - relative length of section of rod initially in motion
	t  - time step

organopen.py:

	Animation to illustrate first three normal modes of organ pipe open at one end.
	Plots pressure. Anti-nodes indicated as dashed lines. Nodes indicated as dotted lines.
	Animation freezes on mouse clicks.

organclosed.py:

	Animation to illustrate first three normal modes of organ pipe closed at both ends.
	Plots pressure. Anti-nodes indicated as dashed lines. Nodes indicated as dotted lines.
	Animation freezes on mouse clicks.

sawtooth.py:

	depends on number terms included in series.

tend.py:

	Widget to illustrate how Fourier reconstruction of tent waveform
	depends on number terms included in series.
