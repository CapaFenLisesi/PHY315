twoslit.py:

	Widget to illustrate two-slit, far-field interference
	due to monochromatic light source of negligible angular extent.
	Plots intensity of light versus angle as function
	of d/lambda and theta_0, where d is slit-spacing,
	lambda is wavelength, and theta_0 is angle of
	incidence.
	
incoherent.py:

	Widget to illustrate two-slit, far-field interference
	due to monochromatic, angularly extended, incoherent light source. 
	Plots intensity of light versus angle as function
	of d/lambda and theta_0, where d is slit-spacing,
	lambda is wavelength, and theta_0 is angular
	extent of source.

coherent.py:

	Widget to illustrate two-slit, far-field interference
	due to monochromatic, angularly extended, coherent light source. 
	Plots intensity of light versus angle as function
	of d/lambda and theta_0, where d is slit-spacing,
	lambda is wavelength, and theta_0 is angular
	extent of source.

multislit.py:

	Widget to illustrate multi-slit, far-field, interference
	due to monochromatic light source of negligible angular extent.
	Plots intensity of light versus angle as function
	of d/lambda and delta/lambda, where d is slit-spacing,
	lambda is wavelength, and delta is slit width.

	Input Parameter:

	n - number of slits

singleslit.py:

	Widget to illustrate single-slit far-field interference
	due to monochromatic light source of negligible angular extent.
	Plots intensity of light versus angle as function
	of delta/lambda where delta is slit width,
	and lambda is wavelength.

rectangle.py:

	Widget to illustrate two-dimensional, far-field, interference pattern
	due to rectangular aperture normally illuminated by light from monochromatic 
	source of negligible angular extent. Plots square root of intensity of 
	light versus angle. 

	Input parameter:

	b - Aspect ratio of aperture.

rayleigh.py:

	Widget to illustrate Rayleigh criterion for resolving
	power of telescope. Plots intensity versus angle as
	a function of Delta_theta where Delta_theta is
	angular distance between two neighbouring stars.
